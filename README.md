### webOS TV System Components

webOS TV is built on Linux and includes a rich set of essential services that enable apps to manage media, devices, security, networking, TV functionalities, and more. The System Bus (Luna Bus) acts as a communication channel between apps and webOS services, such as App Manager, Media Manager, and Notification Manager, as shown in the diagram above. Apps can also access custom services provided by third-party developers through the System Bus.

### Web Apps

Web apps for webOS TV are similar to standard web apps and can be created using standards-based web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are two types of web apps for webOS TV: packaged web apps and hosted web apps.

### JavaScript Services

webOS TV supports JavaScript services created using Node.js. These services can perform background processing, low-level networking, access the file system, and more. Apps can access webOS JavaScript services through the webOS TV System Bus.
