### webOS TV System Components
webOS TV is based on Linux, and its core contains a rich set of essential services that enable apps to manage media, devices, security, networking, TV functionalities, and more. And the System Bus(Luna Bus) is a channel through which apps communicate with webOS services, such as App Manager, Media, and Notification Manager in the diagram above. Apps can also access custom services, provided by 3rd party developers, through the System Bus.

### Web Apps
Web apps built for webOS TV are basically very similar to standard web apps. You can create web apps for webOS TV using standards-based web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are two types of web apps you can build for webOS TV - packaged web apps and hosted web apps.

### JavaSript Services
webOS TV supports JavaScript services. webOS TV JavaScript services are created using Node.js. JavaScript services can perform background processing, low-level networking, access to the file system, and more. Apps can access the webOS JavaScript services through the webOS TV System Bus.
